            <p>This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue">this span of text is blue</span><span class="fancy"> and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span> because they belongs to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.</p>
            <!--Use whitespace to use two classes in a span attribute -->
            <p>On the other hand, <span class="blue fancy">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span></p>

        <div>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</div>
